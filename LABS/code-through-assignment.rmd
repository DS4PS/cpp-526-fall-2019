# What is a Code-Through? 

A code-through is a short tutorial where you explain how to do something in R. They are similar to [explainer videos](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/explainer-videos) that you often see shared.


They can come in many styles, sizes, and themes. Here are some examples to get you thinking: 

* [choropleth maps](http://www.rpubs.com/cenuno/choropleth_map)   
* [making clever graphics](https://davidsmale.netlify.com/portfolio/happy-days/)  
* [network visualization](https://kateto.net/network-visualization) 
* [more maps](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html)  
* [analysis of trees](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ForestTools/vignettes/treetopAnalysis.html) 
* [predicting child maltreatment](http://urbanspatialanalysis.com/portfolio/an-open-source-geospatial-risk-predictive-framework-for-child-maltreatment/)

# Why Do a Code-Through? 

It is very useful to learn how to explain the steps needed to successfully complete a task or replicate results. Within organizations they are very useful for training new hires, collaborating on projects, and creating internal knowledge banks. 

Quickly skimming some examples above, what are the best elements to include in a tutorial to make it clear and accessible? 

<br>

# What Should We Explain? 

For this assignment your code-through should be short and simple. It can be as short as two printed pages, or as long as you like.

You can focus your code-through on:

* A demonstration of a topic from class or a programming trick you have learned this semester. 
* A tour of a dataset that you have found, and how it might be used. 
* An introduction to a new package or function. 

<br> 

# What Should I Include? 

Create your code-through tutorial in an RMD document. 

Include anything that you need to get your ideas across. You might consider:

* Images 
* Adding [extra labels](https://ds4ps.org/cpp-523-fall-2019/labs/figures/reading-a-regression-table.png) to tables or graphs 
* Print glimpses of datasets before and after manipulations so the user can see what has changed 
* Toy datasets that can be useful for demonstrating points 


# What to Submit? 

Submit your RMD and knitted HTML file on Canvas. 

Also post a link to your file on Yellowdig and explain your concept to your classmates.
