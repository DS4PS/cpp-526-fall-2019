*More practice using the plot() function in R and a various graphing functions.*

## Replicating NYT Graphics

For this lab you will be replicating the following [NYT Graphic](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/29/sports/baseball/Strikeouts-Are-Still-Soaring.html?_r=0&ref=baseball). 

![](figures/strikeouts.png)

You will use the following functions:

```{r, eval=F}
plot()  or plot.new() + plot.window()
axis()
points()
segments()
text()
abline()
title()
gray()
```

# Data

The data comes from the Lahman baseball data package. The **Teams** dataset contains season statistics for each baseball team from the late 1800s onward. The graph reports average strike-outs per game, which is calculated as **ave.so** below:


```{r load_data}
library( Lahman )
data( Teams )
ave.so <- Teams$SO / Teams$G
```


```{r, echo=F}
head( Teams )
```

*Note that you don't have to understand baseball to make the graphic.*

# Lab Instructions

1.	Plot average strike-outs by year. Use the gray() function to select a color, and add transparency.

2.	Use appropriate x and y axis conventions and labels. Use 1900 as the starting year for the graph using the xlim=c() argument.

3.	Calculate the league average using group_by() year or tapply(), and add it to the graph. Use the argument type=“b” to connect the dots.

4.	Reproduce at least two of the narrative texts (“US enters World War I”, etc.). Note that a line break within text is created by including “\\n” in your string. 

For example:

```{r, eval=F}
text( x, y, text="Strike zone enlarged /nfrom 1963 to 1968." )
```


Your final plot should be as similar as possible to the NYT graphic.

# Submission Instructions

When you submit your file, please do not zip them this time. Canvas seems to manage the HTML files fine, and it is much easier for me to grade when they are not zipped! 

Login to Canvas at <http://canvas.asu.edu> and navigate to the assignments tab in the course repository. Upload your zipped folder to the appropriate lab submission link.

Remember to:

* name your files according to the convention: **Lab-##-LastName.Rmd**
* show your solution, include your code.
* do not print excessive output (like a full data set).
* follow appropriate style guidelines (spaces between arguments, etc.).
