## The R Toolkit


In this course we cover the foundations of data programming with the R language. In order to create robust and dynamic analysis we need to use a couple of tools that were built to leverage the power of R and create compelling narratives. R Studio helps you manage projects by organizing files, scripts, packages and output. Markdown is a simple formatting convention that allows you to create publication-quality documents. And R Markdown is a specific version of Markdown that allows you to combine text and code to create data-driven documents.

## Welcome !

R is a foundational tool within a toolkit that I will refer to as the "data science ecosystem". 

If you were not able to make either Zoom session, I did a brief introduction to the "ecosystem" - the community of people that are creating cool analytical tools and building tutorials and case studies for how they might be applied, as well as a core set of tools that are all designed to work nicely together in order to implement projects. 

You can think of R, R Studio, and Markdown kindof like Excel (analysis), Word (report-writing), and Power Point (presentations). R allows you to analyze your data, but these results are not useful unless you can share them with others. Here is where [data-driven documents](http://ds4ps.org/dp4ss-textbook/ch-030-data-driven-docs.html) developed using R Studio and Markdown really shine. You can quickly package your R code as cool reports, websites, presentations, or dashboards to format the information in whatever way is most accessible and useful for your clients or stakeholders.

## Getting Help

Nerds are stereotypically perceived as being hermetic, but in reality they have just created their own universes and civilizations. Surprisingly coding is a very social activity, and real-world analytics projects are almost always collaborative. You will learn how to use discussion boards to accelerate learning and facilitate collaboration, and social coding tools like GitHub to manage large data project. 

We are going to throw a lot at you, but also provide a lot of support. Over these first couple of weeks feel free to reach out for anything you might need. 

If you find something confusing let me know (likely others will as well). 

* We can jump on a [Zoom call](https://calendly.com/lecy/15min?month=2019-08) to do a screen share if you want to walk through anything.   
* You can post a question to the homework discussion board for [data science I](https://ds4ps.org/cpp-526-fall-2019/help/) or [program evaluation I](https://ds4ps.org/cpp-523-fall-2019/help/).  
* And you can join review sessions each week.  

Reach out if you have questions or feel stuck!

## The Promise of Big, Open Data


The world is simultaneously generating more data than it has ever before, as well as pushing for policies for making government data more accessible and democratic. These trends and movements is an important enabling aspect of data science, becuse it provides opportunity for real insights that can change our understanding of systems and allow us to hold institutions accountable.

So ignoring potential problems with big and open data for now, read about two interesting cases where big and open data have offered deep insights into city planning and human nature.

# Beginning

*Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, and I really wish somebody had told this to me.*

*All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But it's like there is this gap. For the first couple years that you're making stuff, what you're making isn't so good. It’s not that great. It’s trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it’s not that good.*

*But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you. A lot of people never get past that phase. They quit.*

*Everybody I know who does interesting, creative work they went through years where they had really good taste and they could tell that what they were making wasn't as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short. Everybody goes through that.*

*And if you are just starting out or if you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you're going to finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you're going to catch up and close that gap. And the work you're making will be as good as your ambitions.*

*I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It takes awhile. It’s gonna take you a while. It’s normal to take a while. You just have to fight your way through that.*

*—Ira Glass [on failure](https://jamesclear.com/ira-glass-failure)*

---

*It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.*

## A Tour of R Packages

You might not have heard, but [nerd is the new black](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323478304578332850293360468), data science is the [sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century), and there is [nothing hotter](http://www.startfactor.pt/uploads/3/8/5/0/38505347/r-is-still-hot.pdf) than learning R.

But what is R, and what are the ~~nerds~~ cool kids using it for? 

**This week, your task is to explore a few blogs about tools in R and find one package or application that you are excited about. It can be an analytics package, a graphics package, a specific application, or a tutorial on a topic that interests you. I don't expect you use of understand the package or tutorial, rather just identify a tool that would be useful given your interests.**

Mine, personally, was the package that allows you to create comic strip graphics in R:

[xkcd comics](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12675147/how-can-we-make-xkcd-style-graphs)

Take note, this assignment asks you to explore a new community where the technical language is unfamiliar and the volume of information vast. There are currently over 15,000 packages available in R! Part of the goal of the assignment is to recognize the sheer volume of creativity in the R community and the scope of work that can be done with the language. But the immediate learning objective is to find some sources that make the content accessible. Here are a few to get you started:

[awesome r](https://awesome-r.com/)

[cran views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)

[best of r blogs](https://blog.feedspot.com/r_programming_blogs/)

[r-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)

## Lab-02 - Constructing Groups

Read the following sections from the [course chapter on groups](http://ds4ps.org/dp4ss-textbook/p-050-business-logic.html) before starting the lab:

1 Constructing Groups    
- 1.1 Logical Operators  
- 1.2 Selector Vectors  
- 1.3 Usefulness of Selector Vectors  
2 Subsets  
- 2.1 Compound Logical Statements  
- 2.2 The Opposite-Of Operator  

The rest of the chapter is useful information to come back to, but not needed for the lab. Similar to last week the chapter will highlight some easy ways to make errors with your code, not to convince you that R is hard, but rather to ensure you are paying attention to some subtle features of computer languages that can impact your data.

### Advice on Learning R

> People naturally go through a few phases. When you start out, you don’t have many tips and techniques at your disposal. So, you are forced to do the simplest thing possible using the simplest ideas. And sometimes you face problems that are really hard to solve, because you don’t know quite the right techniques yet. So, the very earliest phase, you’ve got a few techniques that you understand really well, and you apply them everywhere because those are the techniques you know.
> 
> And the next stage that a lot of people go through, is that you learn more techniques, and more complex ways of solving problems, and then you get excited about them and start to apply them everywhere possible. So instead of using the simplest possible solution, you end up creating something that’s probably overly complex or uses some overly general formulation.
> 
> And then eventually you get past that and it’s about understanding, “what are the techniques at my disposal? Which techniques fit this problem most naturally? How can I express myself as clearly as possible, so I can understand what I am doing, and so other people can understand what I am doing?” I talk about this a lot but think explicitly about code as communication. You are obviously telling the computer what to do, but ideally you want to write code to express what it means or what it is trying to do as well, so when others read it and when you in the future reads it, you can understand some of the reasoning.

## R Graphics Packages

This week you will begin working in the core R graphics engine. This discussion topic offers an opportunity to explore some of the myriad [graphics packages in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Graphics.html).

Your task is to select a specialized graphic that you could use in your own (hypothetical) research or professional life, then describe what data or topic from your own work the visualization would be useful for. Reference the R package you would need for the task.

For example, I might say that I work creating budgets for a government organization. I could use a [Sankey Diagram](https://www.getrichslowly.org/sankey-diagrams/) from the [D3 Package](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/sankey-diagram/) to visualize our budget. 

You will find sites like the [R Graphs Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) and [The Data Viz Project](https://datavizproject.com/) helpful.

#### Bad Graphs

There is a lot of science behind data visualization, but the art to storytelling with data can be hard to distill into a few basic principles. As a result, it takes time to learn how to do it well. The best way to develop data visualization skill is to regularly consume interesting graphics. David McCandless is one of the best ambassadors for the field of graphic design and visualization. Check out his TED Talk,  and some excerpts from his book [*Information is Beautiful*]( https://github.com/DS4PS/Data-Science-Class/raw/master/READINGS/mccandless_information_is_beautiful.pdf).

<div style="max-width:560px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/david_mccandless_the_beauty_of_data_visualization" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

Unfortunatly, it is much easier to create tragically bad graphics than it is to create good graphics. For your blog this week, read the *Calling Bullshit* overview on [proportional ink](https://callingbullshit.org/tools/tools_proportional_ink.html) and [misleading axes](https://callingbullshit.org/tools/tools_misleading_axes.html) to develop some sensitivity about misleading graphics. 

Find a graph that violates one of these principles, or commits an equally egregious visualization crime. Share the graph and explain what offense has been committed. You might start by searching for "bad graphs" on google images.

** Week 5 - Data Wrangling 


*** { @unit = "", @title = "Unit Overview", @foldout }

<br>

## Description

This unit focuses on the important task of "**data wrangling**", various manipulations that allow you to quickly filter, join, sort, transform, and describe your data. The **dplyr** package and **tidyverse** tools are some of the most popular in R. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit you will be able to:

* Subset data by rows or columns
* Create multi-dimensional summary tables by grouping data
* Generate new variables through transformations of existing variables 
* Write efficient "data recipes" using pipe operators 
 

## Assigned Reading

Read the notes on data wrangling in R:

* [Data Verbs in dplyr](http://ds4ps.org/dp4ss-textbook/p-070-data-verbs.html)  
* [Data Recipes Using Pipes](http://ds4ps.org/dp4ss-textbook/p-072-data-recipes.html)  
* [Efficient Use of Groups](http://ds4ps.org/dp4ss-textbook/p-073-group-structure.html)

*** { @unit = "TUES Sept 24th", @title = "Discussion Topic Data APIs", @assignment, @foldout  }

<br>
<br>

### Data APIs

Part of the reason data science has grown so much as a field in recent years is because of advances in computing technologies that allows us to run powerful programs and to work with large datasets on personal computers. But just as important, data has become so ubiquitous, cheap, and valuable for organizations. 

Your skill level in data science can be measured by how quickly you can take a real-world problem and produce analysis that offers better solutions than the status quo. Analyzing the data is important, but the process of obtaining data is not a trivial step. Having knowledge about where to look for data, or how to augment your existing data, will help you be more effective as an analyst. 

Next week we will discuss some ways to get data into R. You can always download data from a website in its current format (CSV, SPSS, or Stata, etc.) then import it into R. Alternatively, it is typically more efficient to use an API.

API stands for "Application Programming Interface", which is computer science jargon for the protocols that allow two applications to speak to each other. If you are using your mobile phone and you want to log into your bank using an app, an API will send your user credential and password to your bank, and will return information about your balances and transactions. In other words, APIs are structured ways of sending requests back and fourth between systems. The provide permission for external users to query some parts of internal databases (e.g. what is my checking account balance?), and control what information will be returned.

In some cases, organizations that host public datasets have created data APIs to make it easier to request and share the data. To see some examples visit the [Data Science Toolkit](http://www.datasciencetoolkit.org) website, and test out some APIs. In some cases you give some search parameters (such as a zip code), and it returns a new dataset (census data). In other cases, you send data (raw text), and the API sends you a processed version of the data (a sentiment score based upon words in the text). Thus APIs can be used both to access new data sources, as well as to clean or process your current data as part of your project.

The R community has made a lot of APIs easier to use by creating packages that allow you to access data directly in R using custom functions. For example, the Twitter package allows you to request tweets from specific dates and users, and sends back a dataset of all tweets that meet your criteria (with limits on how much you can access at a time). 

R packages translate the API into functions that will translate your request into the correct API format, send the request, return the data directly into R, and often convert it into an easy to use format like a data frame. In this way, you can quickly access thousands of datasets in real time through R, and you can also store your requests in scripts for future use.

For the discussion topic this week find an example of an API that could be useful for your work. For example, I use a lot of federal data. I was excited to learn that the website [Data USA](https://datausa.io/) has created a public API that allows users to access over a dozen federal datasets:

[Tutorial on Data USA API](https://gist.github.com/lecy/0aa782a873cd174573f32d243233ca5b)

You can find APIs through a Google search, or browse datasets on the [DS4PS Open Data](https://ds4ps.org/data/) page. Altnernatively, you can report on a package in R that uses a data API and describe what kinds of data the package allows you to access. 

*Note, you do not have to show how to use the API for the post, just identify what information is accessible and how it might be used.*

** Week 6 - Data IO and Joins



*** { @unit = "", @title = "Unit Overview", @foldout }

<br>

## Description

This week has you continue practicing "**data wrangling**". This week will add the step of joining multiple datasets prior to analysis. We will continue to use the **dplyr** package. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit you will be able to:

* Merge two related datasets using join functions
* Identify appropriate keys for joins 
* Determine whether you need an inner, outer, or full join

## Lab 

Lab 06 will use Lahman data on baseball for some [moneyball examples](https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-moneyball-part-1-b93b3b9f5b53). 

We will join the Salaries table to player bios (Master table) and performance data (Batting and Fielding) to assess which characteristics predict salary and which teams have been able to most efficiently convert salary to wins.

## GitHub for Government

Hear me out. The government is just one big open-source project. 

Except currently the source code is only edited irregularly by one giant team, and they debate every single change, and then vote on it. 

The code is now millions of lines long, and most of it doesn't do what it was originally designed for, but it is too exhausting to make changes so they just leave it. There are lots of bugs, and many features do not work.

Despite the flaws, the code somehow still functions (albeit very slowly now, like really slow), and the fan is making funny noises, and sometimes we get a blue screen during the budget process and it shuts down for a few weeks. But when it is re-started, it still kinda works. 

---

It's an imperfect metaphor, but many people have theorized that government can learn a lot from how open source projects are managed (or governed if we are being precise).

### GitHub’s official Government Evangelist

> Ben Balter wants to get all up in the U.S. government’s code, and he thinks you should be able to as well. Balter, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer, is GitHub’s official Government Evangelist. His purpose: to educate government agencies about adopting open-source software.

My favorite Ben Balter project was something simple. GIS files are notoriously large and hard to work with (for some reason GIS shapefiles still split data into five separate files that you have to keep together for them to work properly). 

The open source community has created some better data structures that are more efficient and easier to share (geoJSON files), but the geographers that work for cities were all trained on ArcGIS products so it's all they know! Ben wrote a script that downloaded all of Washington DC's open data files, converted them to better formats, then uploaded them to GitHub so others have access. 

https://github.com/benbalter/dc-maps

It might seem trivial - but geoJSON files can be read into R directly from GitHub, making it easy to deploy the data for a wide variety of purposes:

```r
library( geojsonio )
library( sp )
github <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benbalter/dc-maps/master/maps/2006-traffic-volume.geojson"
traffic <- geojson_read( x=github, method="local", what="sp" )
plot( traffic, col="steelblue" )
```
**traffic data from dc**

![](assets/img/dc-traffic.png)

For this week, read about how [GitHub has evolved to support government](https://readwrite.com/2014/08/14/github-government-ben-balter-open-source/).

Do you think open source frameworks would help open the black box and make government more accessible? Would government become more accessible, or alienate regular citizens that are not computer scientists? Would it make influence from special interests more transparent, or would it make it easier for them to hijack the process of shaping local laws?
