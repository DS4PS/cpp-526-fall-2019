# INTRODUCTION

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

mosaicplot( HairEyeColor, shade = TRUE)

```



# MOST IMPORTANT CHUNK SETTING

If you are working on labs, which have several questions, and you are stuck on one question then your code might not work properly. Markdown documents will not render if code has errors. 

If you want credit for attempting the question, then you need to submit your broken code and note that it doesn't work. You can do this by telling R to include a code chunk, but not evaluate it. 


````markdown
`r ''````{r, eval=F}
# code here
`r ''````
````

This way you can still knit your file even if all of the code is not working. 


# KNITTING

When you **Knit** your RMD file, know that R Studio will start from a clean slate (a fresh R environment). 

Students often run into a common problem. As you are developing solutions you might create a subset and save it as a new object:

```{r, eval=F}
dat.treated <- dat[ dat$study.group == "treatment" , ]
```

But you do this in the console (the bottom window) and not in a chunk in your RMD file. 

Your RMD chunks work interactively because when you are running them in real time they use your current environment. But then you try to knit your file R will tell you it can't find specific object (`dat.treated` in this example). 

This is because you never added the code to create the new object in a chunk. It only exists in your current local environment.

Students will also paste the commands to load data for the lab into the console directly, then have similar problems with knitting. 

If you get an error that an object can't be located, check to see if you have included the R code to create the object (load or alter datasets usually) in a chunk. 

## Required Packages

You need to load all libraries required for analysis inside a chunk. Otherwise you will run into the same problem as above. WHen you knit you will get an error message that R cannot find specific functions. It is because they live in a package that you loaded locally, but never added to your script. 

**NOTE** that you load packages in an RMD document while knitting, but you cannot install a package while knitting (neither should you - you only need to install a library once then just load it after that).


```{r, eval=F}

install.packages("tidyverse")   # BAD - do not include this

library( tidyverse )            # GOOD

```




# SETUP

It is a recommended best practice to load all of your R packages and datasets at the beginning of your file instead of scattering these steps throughout. 

There are also some basic steps you will need to set the formatting options for your markdown document. 


## YAML Header

Markdown documents require a YAML header. Many formatting options are set in the header. You will specify:
* The type of document generated (word, html, website, book, etc.) 
* The formatting rules for the document 

The most basic header looks like this:

```{md, eval=F}
---
title: "R Markdown Template"
output: html_document:
---

```

Here are the current options for this document:

```{md, eval=F}
---
title: "R Markdown Template"
author: "Jesse Lecy"
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`"
output:
  html_document:
    df_print: paged
    theme: cerulean
    highlight: haddock
    toc: yes
    toc_depth: 3
    toc_float:
      collapsed: false
      smooth_scroll: true
    code_fold: show
---

```




## knitr Global Options

The `opts_chunk$set()` function allows you to set options that impact all chunks in the document.

```{r setup, include=TRUE, eval=F}

knitr::opts_chunk$set( echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8 )

```

**Please turn your warning messages off before submitting labs!** These are usually not important (R lets you know that your package version is not the current one, for example), but they quickly clutter the assignments. 


You can also customize options directly in each chunk. 

```{md, eval=F}
{r, message=FALSE, fig.width=10}
```



## Packages

Always load packages at the top of the file in one chunk. 

```{r packages}
library( tidyverse )
```


It's a bad idea to hide library() calls throughout your RMD because you cannot easily keep track of which packages are needed for a project, and loading packages multiple times can cause unwanted behaviors. 


## Data

Similarly, files are easier to maintain if you load all of the necessary data once at the top of the file instead of scattering load operations throughout. 

```{r data}

# load raw project datasets here

```

**PRO TIP**: If you have a large dataset that takes time to load, consider using the **cache** argument to your load data chunk. This saves a version of your RMD file that already has data pre-loaded and will open much faster than re-loading data every time you want to knit the file. 






# MARKDOWN FORMATTING RULES

Examples taken from [Adam Pritchard's Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet).

### Headers

```{md, eval=F}

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------
  
```



### Emphasis

```{md, eval=F}

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

### Lists

```{md, eval=F}

Ordered lists:

1. First ordered list item 
2. Another item
     1. Sub-item A
     2. Sub-item B
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
5. And another item.  
   
Unordered list:

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
     * sub-item
     - sub-item
     + sub-item
   
```

+ Or pluses
     * sub-item
     - sub-item
     + sub-item

### Links

There are two ways to create links.

```{md, eval=F}

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

```

### Images

Here's a logo (hover to see the title text):

```{md, eval=F}
Inline-style: 
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Reference-style: 
![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 2"

```


Inline-style:

Reference-style: 
![alt text][logo]

### Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

```{md, eval=F}

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. 
You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3


```

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |

| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |



Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**

### Blockquotes

```{md, eval=F}

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

```


> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.






### Horizontal Lines

Use three or more of the following:

```{md, eval=F}

---  # Hyphens

***  # Asterisks

___  # Underscores

```

Hyphens

---


Asterisks

***



Underscores

___



### Mathematical Formulae

A full description of TeX math symbols is beyond the scope of this cheatsheet. Here's a good reference, and you can try stuff out on CodeCogs. You can also play with formulae in the Markdown Here options page.

Here are some examples to try out:

```{md, eval=F}

$-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$
$x = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \frac{1}{a_3 + a_4}}}$
$\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon$

```

$-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$
$x = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \frac{1}{a_3 + a_4}}}$
$\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon$


The beginning and ending dollar signs ($) are the delimiters for the TeX markup.







### YouTube Videos


```{md, eval=F}

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

OR iframes:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

```


<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>






# DOCUMENT STYLES

R Markdown documents are extremely customizable using options in the header section and in chunks. 



## Appearance and Style 

There are [many options](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html) that control the appearance of HTML documents:

* **theme** specifies the Bootstrap theme to use for the page (themes are drawn from the Bootswatch theme library). Valid themes include "default", "cerulean", "journal",  "flatly", "readable", "spacelab", "united", "cosmo", "lumen", "paper", "sandstone", "simplex", and "yeti". Pass null for no theme (in this case you can use the css parameter to add your own styles).

* **highlight** specifies the syntax highlighting style. Supported styles include "default", "tango", "pygments", "kate", "monochrome", "espresso", "zenburn",  "haddock", and "textmate". Pass null to prevent syntax highlighting.

* **smart** indicates whether to produce typographically correct output, converting straight quotes to curly quotes, --- to em-dashes, -- to en-dashes, and ... to ellipses. Note that smart is enabled by default.

For example:

```{md, eval=F}
---
title: "Habits"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: united
    highlight: tango
---
```
